# 🖼️ Task 2 — Simple Image Encryption Tool

## ✨ Description

A simple Python tool that uses pixel manipulation to **encrypt and decrypt images**.  
It works by swapping pixel color channels and inverting colors — a fun way to hide and reveal your images!

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Encrypt:**  
  Swaps Red ↔ Blue channels and inverts RGB values for each pixel.
- **Decrypt:**  
  Runs the same operation again to get back the original image.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install Pillow:  
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
📂 Example Usage
Input: test_image.png

Encrypted Output: output_test_image.png

Decrypted Output: output_test_image.png (same process)
